## **📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on building a **spam email detection system** using Python and machine learning. The goal is to classify emails as either **ham (legitimate)** or **spam (unwanted/malicious)**.

## **⚙️ Steps Involved**

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Feature Extraction** – Converting text into numerical form.
3. **Model Training** – Using algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM.
4. **Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Optimization** – Hyperparameter tuning for better results.
6. **Deployment Idea** – Integration into email filtering systems.

## **📊 Key Results**

* Dataset contained **13.41% spam** and **86.59% ham**.
* Common spam keywords: *“free,” “call,” “text,” “now”*.
* **Best Model:** Multinomial Naive Bayes with **98.49% accuracy**.
